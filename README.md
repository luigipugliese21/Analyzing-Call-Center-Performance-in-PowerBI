# README for Call Routing Analysis Project
## Overview
This project encompasses the development and implementation of a technical solution for analyzing the funnel/flow of calls received by a company from the marketing platform Invoca until they reach an agent. The tool provides stakeholders with insights into the call drop rate by time of day, marketing channel, and campaign segment.

## Key Metrics
- Gross Calls: The total number of calls arriving in Invoca.
- Left Invoca: The number of calls routed to CXone.
- CXone IVR Calls: The number of calls entering the PreQueue.
- InQueue Calls: The number of calls transitioning from PreQueue to Queue.
- Routed Calls: The number of calls assigned an agent.
- Handled Calls: The number of calls actually handled by an agent.
- Paid & Handled Calls: The number of calls handled by an agent that met the paid threshold.
  
## Findings
An average of only 30-40% of calls were actually handled by an agent, while ideally, this should be close to 100%.
The provided data allows identification of the points where calls are most frequently dropped.

## Significance
The project uncovers critical data that helps understand the effectiveness of the call handling process.
Stakeholders can make informed decisions on how to improve call routing, reduce drop rates, and increase the percentage of calls handled by agents.
Insights derived from the tool can guide operational changes, marketing strategies, and customer service training programs.

## Technical Specifications
The tool uses Power BI for data visualization and analysis.
It sources data from multiple streams, including direct marketing channels and third-party systems.
The data model integrates various dimensions such as time and date, providing a comprehensive view of the call handling process.

## Conclusion
The Call Routing Analysis Project is a potent demonstration of applying data analytics to optimize business processes. It showcases a pragmatic approach to solving real-world problems and is a valuable addition to any portfolio that emphasizes technical acumen and business impact.
